# Sports League Fixture Generator
 This C# program creates a balanced fixture for an 18-team sports league over 36 weeks. It ensures fair matchups, with each team playing against different opponents every week. After the 18th week, the fixtures of the first 17 weeks repeat, but with the home and away roles switched.
